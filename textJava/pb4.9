Root level weight = 0;
Read and set each Node weight;
Use hashTable to save Node data and its weight

every node has distinct value, so use node data as key of hashTable, save its weight as hashValue

[3,0], [1,1], [6,1], [0,2], [2,2], [5,2], [7,2]

iterate through hash

[0,{3}]
[1, {1,6}]
[2, {0,2,5,7}]


Map<Integer, Integer[]> ws = new hashTable<Integer, Integer[]>;

public void binarySearchTreeTraversalByLevel(Node node, int initWeight){
	if(node == null)
		return
	weight = initWeight;	
	if(ws.get(weight) == null)

	
	binarySearchTreeTraversalByLevel(node.left, weight+1);
	binarySearchTreeTraversalByLevel(node.right, weight+1);
